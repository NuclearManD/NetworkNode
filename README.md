# NetworkNode

This repo is meant to work as the internet "glue" for a network I am building.

The project manages a NuclearBlocks fork called Freechain that works as a database with no currency.

Additionally this project is meant to work with radio modules to provide network connection to electronic devices without wifi or cell service.
