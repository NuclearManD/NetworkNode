# NetworkNode

This repo is meant to work as the internet "glue" for a network I am building.

~~The project manages a NuclearBlocks fork called Freechain that works as a database with no currency.~~

~~Additionally this project is meant to work with radio modules to provide network connection to electronic devices without wifi or cell service.~~
 > That will be done with other devices interfacing with this software.
 
 This node also serves as a webserver for websites on the blockchain.  This feature is still quite beta.
